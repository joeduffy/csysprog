This repo was unfortunately short-lived.  Please watch [slice.net](https://github.com/joeduffy/slice.net) and
[corefxlab](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab) for future improvements to .NET systems programming discussed in
[my QCon 2016 talk](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/csharp-systems-programming).  Thanks for your interest.
